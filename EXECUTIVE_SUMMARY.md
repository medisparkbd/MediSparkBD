## Security Features

1. **Authentication**
   - Firebase Google OAuth 2.0
   - Client-side: popup + redirect fallback
   - Server-side: Token verification via Firebase Admin SDK

2. **Authorization**
   - Admin: UID + verified email fallback (survives Firebase project changes)
   - Role-based access control (admin, content-manager, etc.)
   - Permission-scoped endpoints

3. **Database Security**
   - TLS enforced (Azure MySQL requirement)
   - Connection pooling (prevents exhaustion)
   - Parameterized queries (prevents SQL injection)
   - Transactional operations (atomic updates)

4. **API Security**
   - Bearer token validation on all protected endpoints
   - Coupon validation (server-side recalculation, never trust client)
   - Transaction ID uniqueness (prevents duplicate payments)
   - Input validation (all user inputs sanitized)

5. **Exam Security**
   - Answer locking (correct answers never sent to client)
   - Session tracking (device changes auto-submit)
   - Attempt limits enforcement
   - Time gate validation

---

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Frontend
- Deployed on **Vercel** (auto-deploys on push to main)
- CDN for static assets + edge caching
- Serverless functions for API routes

### Database
- **Azure Database for MySQL** (managed service)
- Host: `eduall2005pass.mysql.database.azure.com:3306`
- TLS required, GIPK (auto primary keys) enabled
- Schema managed via SQL migrations

### Media Storage
- **Self-hosted VM** at `medispark.duckdns.org`
- nginx serves `/var/www/medispark-uploads/`
- Token-authenticated upload service on `:4021`
- Fallback: legacy `/api/files/[id]` reads from MySQL LONGBLOB

### Environment Variables
```
MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PORT, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* (web config)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL, FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
MEDIA_UPLOAD_TOKEN, MEDIA_FILES_BASE_URL, MEDIA_UPLOAD_URL, MEDIA_DELETE_URL
```

---

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Unified Exam Engine
- Single codebase powers PUBLIC and COURSE exams
- Differentiated only by access control (not architecture)

### 2. Server-Side Answer Locking
- Correct answers never sent to client during exam
- All scoring done server-side post-submission

### 3. Flow-Based Course Layouts
- Course content can use different structures (Flow 1–5)
- Flow 1 = Direct content (subject → chapters)
- Flow 5 = Exam-centric (chapters → exams)

### 4. Admin Authorization Resilience
- Dual-key lookup: UID + verified email fallback
- Survives Firebase project migrations

### 5. Query Caching
- In-memory LRU cache (500 entries, 5s TTL)
- Auto-invalidates on mutations

### 6. Transactional Enrollments
- Atomic operations prevent inconsistencies
- Row locks prevent race conditions

## Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env  # Fill credentials
pnpm dev             # http://localhost:3000
```

### TypeCheck
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
mysql -h eduall2005pass.mysql.database.azure.com \
  -u <admin> -p bloodare_medispark < src/sql/<file>.sql
```

### Production Deploy
```bash
pnpm build
vercel --prod  # Usually Vercel auto-deploys
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Migrations**: SQL migrations applied manually to Azure
2. **No Rate Limiting**: DDoS risk (consider Vercel limits)
3. **Audio Removed**: Legacy code still references audio submissions
4. **Student ID**: MS-XXXXXXXX generated locally, not globally unique
5. **No Built-in Backups**: Manual MySQL backups required
