/**
 * Public exam access — thin wrapper over the shared exam engine.
 *
 * MASTER PROMPT §50 — "DO NOT build separate exam engines" rule:
 * There is a SINGLE engine (`getExamForTaking` / `fetchExams`) and TWO
 * distinct access services that guard it. This file is the PUBLIC path.
 *
 * Enrolled-kind exams are NEVER accessible via the public path, even when
 * published/live. Public exams are viewable by anyone, but starting/
 * submitting requires an authenticated user (`uid`) and must still respect
 * the live window and attempt limits.
 *
 * @param examId - Exam id (e.g. "hsc-26-model-01")
 * @param uid - Firebase uid of the student when checking ability to *start*
 *              the exam. Omit / undefined for a pure "can view?" probe —
 *              the service still enforces published/live/enrolled-kind checks
 *              and reports that sign-in is required to start.
